# AddiTrack
AI-driven framework for additive manufacturing that extracts layer height from video frames, builds a dataset with voltage, current, and feed rate, and trains a RandomForest model to simulate time vs. height growth curves with noise modeling. Enables digital twin insights for process optimization.
